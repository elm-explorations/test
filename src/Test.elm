These tests aren't meant to be committed to version control. Instead, use them
when you're brainstorming lots of tests you'd like to write, but you can't
implement them all at once. When you replace `todo` with a real test, you'll be
able to see if it fails without clutter from tests still not implemented. But,
unlike leaving yourself comments, you'll be prompted to implement these tests
because your suite will fail.

If you use `only`, your entire test suite will fail, even if
each of the individual tests pass. This is to help avoid accidentally
committing a `only` to version control.

If you you use `only` on multiple tests, only those tests will run. If you
put a `only` inside another `only`, only the outermost `only`
will affect which tests gets run.

if you use a `skip` inside an `only`, it will still get skipped, and if you use

{-| Take a function that produces a test, and calls it several (usually 100) times, using a randomly-generated input
from a [`Fuzzer`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest/Fuzz) each time. This allows you to
test that a property that should always be true is indeed true under a wide variety of conditions. The function also
takes a string describing the test.

These are called "[fuzz tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing)" because of the randomness.

-- Distribution --


{-| With `Distribution` you can observe statistics about your fuzz test inputs and
assert that a given proportion of test cases belong to a given class.

  - `noDistribution` opts out of these checks.

  - `reportDistribution` will collect statistics and report them after the test
    runs (both when it passes and fails) and so is mostly useful as a temporary
    setting when creating your fuzzers and tests.

  - `expectDistribution` will collect statistics, but only report them (and fail
    the test) if the `ExpectedDistribution` is not met. Handy for checking your
    fuzzers are giving interesting and relevant inputs to your tests.

```elm
fuzzWith { runs = 10000, distribution = noDistribution }

fuzzWith
    { runs = 10000
    , distribution =
        reportDistribution
            [ ( "fizz", \n -> (n |> modBy 3) == 0 )
            , ( "buzz", \n -> (n |> modBy 5) == 0 )
            , ( "even", \n -> (n |> modBy 2) == 0 )
            , ( "odd", \n -> (n |> modBy 2) == 1 )
            ]
    }

fuzzWith
    { runs = 10000
    , distribution =
        expectDistribution
            [ ( Test.Distribution.atLeast 30, "fizz", \n -> (n |> modBy 3) == 0 )
            , ( Test.Distribution.atLeast 15, "buzz", \n -> (n |> modBy 5) == 0 )
            , ( Test.Distribution.moreThanZero, "fizz buzz", \n -> (n |> modBy 15) == 0 )
            , ( Test.Distribution.zero, "outside range", \n -> n < 1 || n > 20 )
            ]
    }
```

The `a` type variable in `Distribution a` is the same type as your fuzzed type.

For example, if you're fuzzing a String with `Fuzzer String` and want to see
distribution information for values produced by this fuzzer, you need to provide
`String -> Bool` functions to your `reportDistribution` or `expectDistribution` calls,
which will in turn produce a `Distribution String`.

Fails the test and reports the distribution if the expected distribution is not met.

Uses a statistical test to make sure the distribution doesn't pass or fail the
distribution by accident (a flaky test). Will run more tests than specified with the
`runs` config option if needed.

This has the consequence of running more tests the closer your expected distribution
is to the true distribution. You can thus minimize and speed up this
"making sure" process by requesting slightly less % of your distribution than
needed.

Currently the statistical test is tuned to allow a false positive/negative in
1 in every 10^9 tests.
