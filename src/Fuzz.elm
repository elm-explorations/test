{-| This is a library of _fuzzers_ you can use to supply values to your fuzz
tests. You can typically pick out which ones you need according to their types.

A `Fuzzer a` knows how to create values of type `a`. It can create them randomly,
so that your test's expectations are run against many values. Fuzzers will often
generate edge cases likely to find bugs. If the fuzzer can make your test fail,
the test runner also knows how to "simplify" that failing input into more minimal
examples, some of which might also cause the tests to fail. In this way, fuzzers
can usually find the simplest input that reproduces a bug.

the true and false cases explicitly.

{-| Map over many fuzzers. This can act as `mapN` for `N > 8`.
The argument order is meant to accommodate chaining:

    Fuzz.constant fn
        |> Fuzz.andMap fuzzerA
        |> Fuzz.andMap fuzzerB
        |> Fuzz.andMap fuzzerC

-}
andMap :: Fuzzer a -> Fuzzer (a -> b) -> Fuzzer b
andMap =
    map2 (|>)


{-| Create a new `Fuzzer` by providing a list of probabilistic weights to use
with other fuzzers.
For example, to create a `Fuzzer` that has a 1/4 chance of generating an int
between -1 and -100, and a 3/4 chance of generating one between 1 and 100,
you could do this:

    Fuzz.frequency
        [ ( 1, Fuzz.intRange -100 -1 )
        , ( 3, Fuzz.intRange 1 100 )
        ]

This fuzzer will simplify towards the fuzzers earlier in the list (each of which
will also apply its own way to simplify the values).

There are a few circumstances in which this function will return an invalid
fuzzer, which causes it to fail any test that uses it:

  - If you provide an empty list of frequencies
  - If any of the weights are less than 0
  - If the weights sum to 0

Be careful recursively using this fuzzer in its arguments. Often using
[`Fuzz.map`](#map) is a better way to do what you want. If you are fuzzing a
tree-like data structure, you should include a depth limit so to avoid infinite
recursion, like so:

    type Tree
        = Leaf
        | Branch Tree Tree

    tree : Int -> Fuzzer Tree
    tree i =
        if i <= 0 then
            Fuzz.constant Leaf

        else
            Fuzz.frequency
                [ ( 1, Fuzz.constant Leaf )
                , ( 2, Fuzz.map2 Branch (tree (i - 1)) (tree (i - 1)) )

{-| A fuzzer that only lets through values satisfying the given predicate
function.

Warning: By using `Fuzz.filter` you can get exceptionally unlucky and get 15
rejections in a row, in which case the test will fluke out and fail!

It's always preferable to get to your wanted values using [`Fuzz.map`](#map),
as you don't run the risk of rejecting too may values and slowing down your
tests, for example using `Fuzz.intRange 0 5 |> Fuzz.map (\x -> x * 2)` instead
of `Fuzz.intRange 0 9 |> Fuzz.filter (\x -> modBy 2 x == 0)`.

If you want to generate indefinitely until you find a satisfactory value (with
a risk of infinite loop depending on the predicate), you can use this pattern:

    goodItemFuzzer =
        itemFuzzer
            |> Fuzz.andThen

    in

{-| Use a generated value to decide what fuzzer to use next.

For example, let's say you want to generate a list of given length.
One (not ideal) possible way to do that is first choosing how many elements
will there be (generating a number), `andThen` generating a list with that many
items:

    Fuzz.intRange 1 10
        |> Fuzz.andThen
            (\length ->
                let
                    go : Int -> List a -> Fuzzer (List a)
                    go left acc =
                        if left <= 0 then
                            Fuzz.constant (List.reverse acc)

                        else
                            itemFuzzer
                                |> Fuzz.andThen (\item -> go (length - 1) (item :: acc))
                in
                go length []
            )

This will work! Different fuzzers will have different PRNG usage patterns
though and will shrink with varying success. The currently best known way to
fuzz a list of items is based on a "flip a coin, `andThen` generate a value and
repeat or end" approach, and is implemented in the [`Fuzz.list`](#list) helpers
in this module. Use them instead of rolling your own list generator!

Think of `andThen` as a generalization of [`Fuzz.map`](#map). Inside
[`Fuzz.map`](#map) you don't have the option to fuzz another value based on
what you already have; inside `andThen` you do.
