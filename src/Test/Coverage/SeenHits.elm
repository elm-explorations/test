module Test.Coverage.SeenHits exposing (SeenHits)

{-| SeenHits track which edges we have seen globally over the course of running
the suite.

For what the edges are exactly, look at docs of Test.Coverage.EdgeHitCounts.

In spirit, SeenHits could be thought of as

    type alias SeenHits =
        Set ( Loc, Loc )

    type alias Loc =
        -- the uniformly random pointId generated by coverage tooling
        Int

But in reality it's a JS Set of integers: the two Loc integers can be combined
into a single integer by shifting and XORing - see docs for
Test.Coverage.EdgeHitCounts for pseudocode.

type SeenHits
    = SeenHits
