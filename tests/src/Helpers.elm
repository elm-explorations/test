{-| To test simplifying, we have to fail some tests so we can simplify their inputs.
The best place we found for storing the expected last state(s) of the simplifying procedure is the description field, which is why we have this function here.
Previously, we (ab)used Expect.true for this, but since that was removed, here we are.
