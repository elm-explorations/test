{-| Log Runner

Runs a test and outputs its results using `Debug.log`, then calls `Debug.crash`
if there are any failures.

This is not the prettiest runner, but it is simple and cross-platform. For
example, you can use it as a crude Node runner like so:

    $ elm-make LogRunnerExample.elm --output=elm.js
    $ node elm.js

This will log the test results to the console, then exit with exit code 0
if the tests all passed, and 1 if any failed.
